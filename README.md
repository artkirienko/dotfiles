I've been using Mac for the last years. At some point, I realized that most of the programs I use can be installed through the Homebrew.

## Install Homebrew

```bash
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

## Clone this repo

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:artkirienko/dotfiles.git
```

or

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/artkirienko/dotfiles.git
```

## Install all the applications from Brewfile

```bash
$ brew bundle
```
